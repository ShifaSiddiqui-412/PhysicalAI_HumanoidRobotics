# Planning of Digital Twin Educational Module

## Prompt

```
Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

1. Set up Module 2 in Docusaurus and create three chapter .md files covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity-based digital twins and HRI, and sensor simulation with validation.

2. Populate each chapter with concise explanations, workflows, and diagrams, ensuring all content is authored in Markdown and aligned with simulation-first humanoid robotics.
```

## Response

Successfully created the implementation plan for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The plan includes:

1. **plan.md**: Complete implementation plan with technical context, constitution check, research tasks, design architecture, and implementation tasks
2. **research.md**: Research document addressing all technical decisions and alternatives
3. **data-model.md**: Data model for the educational site structure
4. **contracts/site-contracts.md**: API contracts for the Docusaurus site
5. **quickstart.md**: Quickstart guide for setting up and developing the module
6. **checklists/requirements.md**: Updated checklist marking all requirements as completed

The plan covers all aspects required for implementing the educational module on digital twins using Gazebo and Unity, including physics simulation, high-fidelity visualization, and sensor simulation with validation. All content will be created in Markdown format for the Docusaurus site, targeting AI and robotics students building simulation-first humanoid systems.
