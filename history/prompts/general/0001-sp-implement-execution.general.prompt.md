# Prompt History Record: sp.implement execution

## PROMPT_TEXT

$ARGUMENTS

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully executed the implementation process for the robotics education modules. Completed the following:

1. Analyzed all three feature modules (ROS2, Digital Twin, Isaac AI Brain)
2. Verified all checklist statuses were complete
3. Implemented Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) by:
   - Creating directory structure in my-website/docs/modules/3-isaac-ai-brain/
   - Creating index.md, chapter-1-isaac-sim.md, chapter-2-isaac-ros.md, and chapter-3-nav2-navigation.md
   - Updating sidebars.ts to include Module 3 in navigation
   - Marking all tasks in specs/3-isaac-ai-brain/tasks.md as completed [X]
4. Validated the implementation with successful Docusaurus build
5. Verified Module 1 and Module 2 were already implemented

All three modules (ROS2 fundamentals, Digital Twin, and Isaac AI Brain) are now properly integrated into the Docusaurus educational site with complete navigation structure.

## OUTCOME

The implementation was successful. All three educational modules are now complete and the Docusaurus site builds correctly. The educational content covers ROS2 fundamentals, Digital Twin simulation concepts, and NVIDIA Isaac technologies for humanoid robotics as specified in the feature requirements.

## EVALUATION

The implementation met all acceptance criteria:
- All required content files were created with appropriate educational content
- Navigation structure was properly updated
- Docusaurus build validation passed successfully
- Tasks were properly marked as completed in the tasks.md file
- Content follows the required format and targets the specified audience
