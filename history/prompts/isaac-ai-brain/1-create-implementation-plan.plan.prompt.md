# Create Implementation Plan for Module 3

## Summary

Successfully created the complete implementation plan for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™), including technical planning, research, data models, quickstart guide, and educational contracts.

## Changes Made

1. Created implementation plan: `specs/3-isaac-ai-brain/plan.md`
2. Created research document: `specs/3-isaac-ai-brain/research.md`
3. Created data model: `specs/3-isaac-ai-brain/data-model.md`
4. Created quickstart guide: `specs/3-isaac-ai-brain/quickstart.md`
5. Created educational contracts: `specs/3-isaac-ai-brain/contracts/educational-content-interactions.md`

## Technical Details

- Plan follows template structure with all required sections
- Research covers NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 technologies
- Data model defines key entities and relationships for educational content
- Quickstart provides implementation workflow and setup instructions
- Contracts define interaction patterns for educational content delivery
- All artifacts integrate with existing Docusaurus documentation structure
