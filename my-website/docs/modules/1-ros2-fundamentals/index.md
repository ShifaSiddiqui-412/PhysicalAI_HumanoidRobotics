# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces students to ROS 2 fundamentals, Python agents with rclpy, and URDF modeling for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 communication primitives (nodes, topics, services)
- Create Python-based ROS 2 agents using the rclpy library
- Interpret and modify URDF files for humanoid robot modeling

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the "nervous system" of humanoid robots, providing a middleware framework that enables different software components to communicate and coordinate with each other. This module will provide you with the foundational knowledge needed to work with ROS 2 in the context of humanoid robotics.

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. **[Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./chapter-1-ros2-fundamentals.md)** - Understanding nodes, topics, and services
2. **[Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy](./chapter-2-python-agents.md)** - Creating Python-based robot controllers
3. **[Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./chapter-3-urdf-modeling.md)** - Creating and modifying robot models

Let's begin with understanding the fundamental communication primitives that make up the ROS 2 ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with command line tools
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Learning Path

We recommend following the chapters in order for the best learning experience, as each builds upon the previous one.
