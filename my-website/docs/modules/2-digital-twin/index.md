# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module introduces students to physics-based simulation with Gazebo and high-fidelity digital twins using Unity for humanoid robotics applications. Students will learn how to create realistic simulated environments, understand sensor simulation, and explore Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of physics-based simulation using Gazebo
- Create and configure humanoid robot models in Gazebo simulation environments
- Implement high-fidelity digital twin representations in Unity
- Simulate various sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMU sensors
- Validate sensor simulation outputs against expected environmental conditions

## Overview

The digital twin concept is fundamental to modern robotics development, allowing engineers to test and validate robot behaviors in safe, controlled virtual environments before deploying to real hardware. This module will guide you through creating realistic simulations using Gazebo for physics and Unity for high-fidelity visualization and interaction.

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. **[Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./chapter-1-physics-simulation.md)** - Understanding physics-based simulation and collision detection
2. **[Chapter 2: Digital Twins and HRI using Unity](./chapter-2-digital-twins-hri.md)** - Creating high-fidelity digital twin representations and interaction
3. **[Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation & Validation](./chapter-3-sensor-simulation.md)** - Simulating and validating robot sensors in virtual environments

Let's begin with understanding the fundamentals of physics-based simulation using Gazebo.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with command line tools
- Basic knowledge of 3D visualization concepts (helpful but not required)

## Learning Path

We recommend following the chapters in order for the best learning experience, as each builds upon the previous one.
