# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This module introduces students to NVIDIA Isaac technologies for humanoid robot perception, navigation, and AI-driven intelligence. Students will learn how to leverage Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception, and Nav2 for sophisticated navigation systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand and implement synthetic data generation techniques using NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Implement perception algorithms using Isaac ROS that leverage hardware acceleration
- Configure and implement navigation systems using Nav2 for humanoid robots
- Demonstrate understanding of accelerated processing for real-time robotics applications
- Apply VSLAM techniques using Isaac ROS with hardware acceleration

## Overview

The AI-Robot Brain represents the cognitive layer of humanoid robotics, where perception, navigation, and intelligence converge. This module will guide you through NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem, focusing on tools that enable AI-driven robotics applications with high-performance computing capabilities.

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. **[Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data](./chapter-1-isaac-sim.md)** - Creating photorealistic simulation environments for synthetic data generation
2. **[Chapter 2: Isaac ROS and Accelerated Perception](./chapter-2-isaac-ros.md)** - Hardware-accelerated perception and VSLAM implementation
3. **[Chapter 3: Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation](./chapter-3-nav2-navigation.md)** - Navigation systems and path planning for humanoid robots

Let's begin with understanding how to create photorealistic simulation environments using NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Knowledge of simulation principles (covered in Module 2)
- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with NVIDIA hardware acceleration concepts (helpful but not required)

## Learning Path

We recommend following the chapters in order for the best learning experience, as each builds upon the previous one.
